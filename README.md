# Warning
This no longer works after version 2.15 of the reMarkable2 software.
I had to revert to 2.14 to make it work.

# PageTurner
An ESP32-based project for turning pages on a tablet when a pedal is pressed

The repo contains: 
- A ESP32 ino sketch (pedalOTA.ino)
- 2 services definition files to be installed on the tablet so that a keyboard (or any device connecting to a USB host device) can be recognized by the tablet
- STL files for printing a nice box around the ESP32

Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/FunkyFab/pageturner/wiki) for more details.
